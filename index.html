            My journey as web developer
        </h2>
        <p>
        Its funny how l became a web-developer.Programing was a far fetched dream which l felt can never be realised in a country like Zimbabwe especially in a small town like Hwange where exposure to tech staff seemed limited at the time, "so  l thought".
        its hilarious how l always admired and wished l could do what kids on tv as young as eight could do like creating their own robots,games and applications. The drive was there but l was just reluctant to take any initiative cause l didnt know where to start from or who to consult.After
        years of a defered dream as well as considering that l didnt have funds to advance to varsity my friend introduced me to a brother of his who was into programming (tech in general), he became my mentor and that was how my
        journey as a web-developer kicked started, in Hwange at that
